radar-reconstruction-features-extraction
========================================

A signal reconstruction routine and a feature extraction routine used in radar processing, written in MATLAB.

1) gauss_reconstruct: Reconstructs a noisy signal by implementing gaussian curves with overlapping frames. Tested with signals having 1024 samples.

2) feat_extract: A feature extraction routine. Detects the valleys and peaks at a given signal. Amplitude, width, slope and distance data are extracted.
